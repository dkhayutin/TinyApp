## Tiny app

Tiny App is an individual project that was completed during week 2 at Lighthouse Labs. The purpose of this app is to convert long URL's to a short specified code, making it easier for individual users to visit the specified website.

This app allowed for practice use of node.js, express.js, HTML5, and Javascript.
